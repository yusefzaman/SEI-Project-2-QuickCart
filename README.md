### **_Description_**

#### The app we propose aims to bring together independent local businesses and buyers who want to support them. The intuitive design will allow the user to view each seller's virtual storefront, where they can then click into each to view the list of items and then into each item to view details on the item and price.

#### If the user is happy with the item, they can add it to their basket and generate an order to purchase the item. The user is also able to leave reviews on the quality and value of the item - for other users to see.
